```

## Local Development

To run the website on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```sh
    cd YDCCWebsiteOnline
    ```

3.  **Start a local server:**
    Since this is a static site, you can use any simple HTTP server. If you have Python installed, you can run:
    ```sh
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Or, for Python 2:
    ```sh
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer
    ```

4.  **View the website:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Photo Gallery Management

The photo gallery on `gallery.html` is designed to be updated without editing any HTML or JavaScript directly.

### How It Works

1.  **Album Folders:** Each photo album is a folder located in `images/Albums/`.
2.  **Update Script:** The Python script `update_gallery.py` scans these folders and generates the `js/album-config.js` file.
3.  **Configuration File:** The website's `gallery.js` reads this config file to display the albums and their images.

### How to Add or Update an Album

1.  **Add/Modify Photos:** Create a new folder in `images/Albums/` or add/remove photos from an existing one. The folder name will be used as the album title.
2.  **Set a Thumbnail (Optional):** To set a specific cover image for an album, name that image `Thumbnail.jpg` (or `.png`, `.webp`, etc.) inside its album folder. The script will prioritize this image as the thumbnail.
3.  **Run the Update Script:** Open a terminal in the project's root directory and run:
    ```sh
    python update_gallery.py
    ```

The gallery will be automatically updated on the website.
